Linear regression (deep learning)

Linear regression attempts to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. One variable is considered to be an explanatory variable, and the other is considered to be a dependent variable. For example, a modeler might want to relate the weights of individuals to their heights using a linear regression model.
A linear regression line has an equation of the form 
Y = a + bX,
where X is the explanatory variable and Y is the dependent variable. 
The slope of the line is b, and a is the intercept (the value of y when x = 0).

We have to predict Salaries on the basis of years of experience.
